# WorldSmith -  a visual game creation plugin for Roblox Studio

## Introduction

WorldSmith is a visual [entity-component-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–component–system) for Roblox Studio. It allows **components** to be tied to instances (which represent **entities**). Components consist **only of data** and are acted upon and managed by **systems.** WorldSmith's interface allows a game creator (the "Smith") to give an instance as many different components as he or she wishes; in this way, game objects can be built with extremely varied and customizable behavior, and changing/adding behaviors is often as simple as editing a few component parameters/adding new components, including during runtime \[!].

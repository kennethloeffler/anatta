They are also called games as a service or simply live games. Regardless of the term we use, it just refers to games that use a recurring revenue model. Development doesn\'t stop after launch; the product is continuously upgraded and sold. This usually means that a decent chunk of development time will be spent creating content for the game: new cosmetic items, gameplay areas, storylines, promotional events. A lot of this work is done by artists and designers, and not necessarily programmers.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}')}}]);
